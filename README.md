## Forks

> To be able to collaborate on Open-Source projects, you need to create forks, which are a "copy" of the repository in your GitHub account in your repository.
> 

**How to fork**

1. Click on the fork button located at the top of the repository menu <img src="assets/fork-button.png" alt="Fork button" height="40px">

3. Creating a fork in confirmation with settings <img src="assets/fork-confirm.png" alt="Fork confirm" height="390px">
4. Code editing at the IDE level or quick editing in GitHub

**Commit dialogs**

> Always fill in dialogs with the truth and exactly what happened in the code. Every forgotten thing can mean a problem in the future (even in the horizon of years), what was actually created where.
